### Project Background:

A blood and marrow transplant (BMT) is a procedure that replaces unhealthy blood-forming cells with healthy ones. An allogeneic transplant uses blood-forming cells donated by someone else instead of one's own blood-forming cells. BMT can treat blood cancers like leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma. It can also treat non-cancerous diseases like aplastic anemia and immune deficiency disorders.

### Data:

The Kaggle competition itself provides a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/equity-post-HCT-survival-predictions/overview) that was synthetically generated by the real data. The dataset consists of 59 variables related to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), encompassing a range of demographic and medical characteristics of both recipients and donors, such as age, sex, ethnicity, disease status, and treatment details. There are 28800 available observations, with part of them consisting of missing values. There is a given test set in which the information of three patients are given and we need to predict their survival rates.

### Target features:

Since this project uses time-to-event data, the outcome is encoded in a pair of columns.

- efs: Column which records whether an adverse event (death or treatment failure) has occurred. Examining the data, it appears the value is either 0.0 (patient exited the study with no event) or 1.0 (event occurred).
- efs_time: Numeric column, which gives event-free survival time in months.

As an example, if a patient has efs=0 and efs_time=32, the patient survived for 32 months and then exited the study with no adverse event. If a patient has efs_time=5 and efs=1.0, the patient died or experienced treatment failure after 5 months.

### KPIs:

- Obtain a risk score function:  A risk score is a real-valued number that quantifies the relative risk of not being able to survive. A higher score means a lower chance to survive. A risk function maps each observation to a risk score.
- Obtain the Stratified Concordance Index for each model:
  - A concordance index (C-index) is a metric in survival analysis used to evaluate a model's ability to correctly rank survival times based on individual risk scores. It is defined as the ratio between the number of evaluable pairs and the number of concordant pairs. In short, a pair is concordant only when the order of risk scores is in line with the order of survival times. C-index is always between 0 and 1. Just like AUC, Higher C-index is better.
  - Stratified concordance index defined as the mean of C-index from different race groups minus the standard deviation of the C-index. Stratified concordance index aims to improve the fairness of the model.

### Other Objectives:

- Explain the model and quantify the explanatory power for important features. (e.g. Shapvalues)
